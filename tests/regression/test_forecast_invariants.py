"""Data-driven invariant regression tests over captured diagnostic JSONs.

Motivation: repo issue #217 — "shift IV&V from bug-discoverer to
guardrail-validator". Each test here is an invariant the LP + price pipeline
should satisfy on any Nimbus install, expressed as a pass/fail assertion
that no future refactor can silently violate.

The initial fixture set (`fixtures/purcell_qld1/`) captures the v0.94.4
post-fix state of Mark Purcell's QLD1 install — Amber Express + Energex 6900
ToU + Sigenergy 40 kWh + both `_sensor_2` slots populated. It's the same
install and same capture that produced issue #216's fix confirmation.

To grow the suite: capture a new install into `fixtures/<name>/` (see
conftest.py's docstring for file layout), and every existing invariant runs
against it automatically via pytest parametrisation.

Naming convention for invariants — four prefixes matching the areas called
out in #217:
  RAW-*   — `_raw` diagnostic attribute conventions
  PRICE-* — price pipeline source pass-through
  SET-*   — settled-block price identity (#220)
  LP-*    — LP output invariants (SoC, power, signs, energy balance)

# SET-* — settled current-block prices are not blended (#220)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Settled prices on the NEM (and, transitively, Amber and Local Volts) are
# the closed value for the current 5-minute dispatch interval. They are a
# fact, not a forecast — nothing Nimbus does downstream can change them,
# and blending them with a secondary forecast produces an artefact that
# doesn't correspond to any real market price. The invariant this section
# codifies is: at the current settlement block (forecast[0], by LP
# convention), the published price MUST equal the primary source sensor's
# live `state`, and it MUST equal its own `_raw` companion (i.e. the blend
# is bypassed for this row).
#
# Regression: v0.94.4 blended the current block against the forecast[] of
# a secondary sensor and *also* published a stale sample as `_raw`. See
# issue #220 for the numeric evidence. v0.94.5 (Raf, 2026-08-27) fixed
# both — the writer now reads primary_sensor.state directly for the
# current row and applies it after any downstream blending.
#
# Tolerance discussion: Nimbus rounds published forecast prices to 4 dp
# ($/kWh), while `state` may carry more precision (e.g. state=0.0318708,
# forecast=0.0319). The tolerance is set at 0.05 c/kWh (5e-4 $/kWh) — half
# a rounding step — which comfortably distinguishes "identity, modulo
# rounding" from "blended value" (which differed by 0.5–1.5 c/kWh in
# the #220 evidence).


def _current_block_row(forecast):

    This is the #220 identity for the import side: the settled block is

    matches the source sensor's `state` (not a stale sample, not a blend).

# to the next block boundary — retain the blended value. `import_price_raw`
# and `export_price_raw` do carry the correct identity value on those rows,
